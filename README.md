# To-Do List Application

## Project Description
In this project, I developed a **To-Do List Application** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of this project was to create a simple yet functional to-do list that allows users to add tasks, display them in a list, and remove tasks when completed.

## Features
- **Add New Tasks**: Users can enter new tasks into the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add them to the task list.
- **Remove Tasks**: Each task has a "Remove" button that allows the user to delete the task from the list when it's done.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Tasks can also be added by pressing the `Enter` key after typing in the input field.
- **Real-Time DOM Manipulation**: All tasks are dynamically added and removed from the DOM without page reloads.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the application, including the input field, button, and task list elements.
- **CSS**: Styles the interface to make it user-friendly and visually appealing. It includes responsive design elements to ensure the application looks good on different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript**: Handles all the interactive parts of the application, including adding new tasks, removing tasks, and handling events (button clicks and key presses).

## How I Built It
1. **HTML Structure**: I started by building a simple HTML structure that includes an input field for entering tasks, a button for adding them, and an unordered list (`<ul>`) for displaying the tasks.
2. **CSS Styling**: I applied CSS to style the application, making it clean and responsive. The task list items, buttons, and overall layout were styled to ensure a good user experience.
3. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - I wrote JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as adding new tasks to the list and removing them.
   - I used **event listeners** to detect button clicks and key presses (`Enter` key) to trigger the task creation process.
   - DOM manipulation was used to dynamically update the list of tasks as users add or remove them.
4. **Task Removal**: Each task has a "Remove" button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list. This was achieved using a simple event handler attached to each remove button.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a basic web server running to avoid any MIME type issues. You can use VSCode's **Live Server** extension or Python's built-in HTTP server.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser using the live server.

## Conclusion
This project helped me strengthen my skills in **DOM manipulation** and **event handling** with JavaScript. It also gave me experience in building a simple, user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS.
